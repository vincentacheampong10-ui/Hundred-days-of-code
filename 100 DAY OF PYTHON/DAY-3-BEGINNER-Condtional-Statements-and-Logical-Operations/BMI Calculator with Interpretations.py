# BMI Calculator with Interpretations
# Add some if/elif/else statements to the BMI calculator so that it interprets the BMI values calculated.
#
# If the bmi is under 18.5 (not including), print out "underweight"
#
# If the bmi is between 18.5 (including) and 25 (not including), print out "normal weight"
#
# If the bmi is 25 (including) or over, print out "overweight"
#
# Refer to this graphic for help:



weight = 85
height = 1.85

bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

# 🚨 Do not modify the values above
# Write your code below 👇

if  bmi < 18.5:
    print("Underweight")

elif bmi <=25:
    print("Normal weight")

else:
    print("Overweight")
